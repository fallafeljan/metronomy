# metronomy

Metronomy is a metronome smartphone application written using
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), intended to resemble
the device I'm used to as musicianâ€”an old Seiko SQ metronome. It currently
features sounds generated by an triangle-wave oscillator using
[Audio Unit](https://developer.apple.com/reference/audiounit), and capabilities
such as different rhythms are on the list.
